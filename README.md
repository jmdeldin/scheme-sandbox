# Scheme Sandbox

This is my own Scheme sandbox I'm developing while reading
[The Little Schemer](http://amzn.to/P1QH9u). I find Scheme very addicting and
empowering -- once you start building your own library, it's hard to stop.
Practical? No. Fun? Yes!

## Requirements

I've only tested this with [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/), but this should
work in other schemes (you might need to change `include` to `load` or
`require` depending on what you're running).

## Usage

Run this in an interactive environment like GNU Emacs or DrRacket.
